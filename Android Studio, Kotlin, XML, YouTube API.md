Android Studio
- The all-in-one IDE for crafting native Android apps.
- Offers drag-and-drop UI design, real-time emulators, and deep performance analysis.
- Great for managing your app’s lifecycle and fine-tuning interactions.
   Kotlin
- The modern language for Android development: concise, safe, and expressive.
- Works seamlessly with Java and has built-in null safety, making your code cleaner and less error-prone.
- You’ll love its coroutine support when dealing with asynchronous tasks like fetching YouTube data.
   XML
- Used for designing Android app layouts—every button, text view, and layout element lives here.
- Pairs with Kotlin to define UI structure while the logic sits in your activities or fragments.
- You can apply your BEM-style SCSS habits here too, with tidy layout IDs and styles.
   YouTube API
- Lets your app tap into YouTube content—search, retrieve video info, embed players.
- With a proper API key and configuration, you can show video previews, create playlists, or even track viewer engagement.
- Especially cool if you’re building something educational, social, or content-driven.
Thinking of integrating this into a media-centric mobile app? Maybe a learning platform, a content browser, or something that syncs with your FYP ideas? I’d love to map out how this could evolve into a full-featured app—or sprinkle in Firebase for real-time updates.
