⚛ React
- Frontend powerhouse you already know and use well.
- Great for dynamic UIs and reusable components, especially when wired to real-time data like Firebase.
   Firebase
- Backend-as-a-Service platform with authentication, Firestore, storage, and analytics.
- Pairs beautifully with React to handle user management and real-time updates without spinning up a custom server.
   SCSS (Sassy CSS)
- A CSS preprocessor that lets you use variables, nesting, and mixins.
- Ideal for keeping styles organized and scalable—especially helpful in larger projects like your FYP.
   BEM (Block Element Modifier)
- A structured naming convention for CSS classes.
- Works wonders when paired with SCSS, making your stylesheets easier to read and maintain.
This combo sets you up for a sleek frontend with smooth state management and styling discipline. It’s especially effective for applications that require dynamic user interaction and clear UI consistency—like your QR code attendance system.
