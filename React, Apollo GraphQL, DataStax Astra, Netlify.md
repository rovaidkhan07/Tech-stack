React
- A powerful frontend library for building interactive UIs.
- You’re already using it for your QR code attendance system—so you know its component-based architecture and use of state hooks make it super modular and maintainable.
 Apollo GraphQL
- A GraphQL client for managing data-fetching from your backend.
- Works seamlessly with React to query only the data you need, avoiding the over-fetching problem of REST APIs.
- Perfect if you're building a UI that’s responsive and tightly coupled with live data.
 DataStax Astra
- A serverless cloud database built on Apache Cassandra.
- Scales effortlessly and is great for apps needing high availability and fast access to large datasets.
- It’s schema-flexible and integrates nicely with GraphQL, especially when paired with Apollo.
Netlify
- A developer-friendly platform for hosting static sites and serverless functions.
- You can deploy React apps in seconds, set up CI/CD pipelines, and even manage environment variables through its dashboard.
- Ideal for quick deploys and smooth collaboration.
If you’re planning to use all of these together, you’re aiming for a modern JAMstack-style setup—fast, scalable, and developer-first. Want me to sketch out how they’d connect in your FYP or build a mini architecture flow?
