React Hooks are functions that allow developers to "hook into" React features like state and lifecycle methods directly within functional components, eliminating the need for class components in many scenarios.
In essence, they are used to:
Add state to functional components:
The useState hook allows components to manage and update data that can change over time.
Perform side effects:
The useEffect hook enables functional components to perform actions like data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM, which would typically be handled by lifecycle methods in class components.
Share reusable stateful logic:
Custom Hooks can be created to encapsulate and reuse complex logic across multiple components.
